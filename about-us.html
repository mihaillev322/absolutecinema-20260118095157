                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>absolutecinema was founded in Canada by AV installers who wanted to bring cinema-quality sound and picture into everyday homes without messy wiring or confusing gear choices. After years of setting up TVs, projectors, and surround sound in condos and houses across Canadian cities, we built a process focused on clean installs, code-aware cabling, and careful calibration. Our mission is simple: make home entertainment feel effortless, reliable, and truly immersive.</p>
                
                <p>What started as a small team of passionate audio-visual technicians has grown into Canada's premier home theatre installation service. We recognized that many homeowners were frustrated with complicated setups, visible cables, and systems that never quite worked as promised. Our founders combined decades of experience in commercial AV installation with a deep understanding of residential needs, creating a service that bridges the gap between professional-grade performance and user-friendly operation.</p>
                
                <p>From our early days installing basic TV mounting services to today's complex Dolby Atmos systems and smart home integration projects, we've maintained our commitment to quality craftsmanship and customer education. Every installation teaches us something new about Canadian homes, from century-old houses with unique structural challenges to modern condos with strict building regulations. This experience has shaped our approach, making us experts in navigating the specific requirements of Canadian residential installations.</p>
                
                <p>Today, absolutecinema serves homeowners across major Canadian cities, bringing cinema-quality entertainment systems into living rooms, basements, and dedicated theatre spaces. Our reputation is built on thousands of successful installations, satisfied customers, and the trust of Canadian families who rely on us to transform their homes into entertainment destinations.</p>
